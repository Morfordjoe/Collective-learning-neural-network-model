# Collective-learning-neural-network-model

This repository contains 3 python scripts. These train neural networks at an orientation task either solo, or in pairs, with a democratic consensus function or a despotic consensus function. These scripts output CSV files (in "Data" directory) contain the data from these simulations. An R script included performs stats and returns graphs from these simulations. 

If running this code, the directory paths will have to be changed. Also, you should check that each dataframe in the R script is associated with the correct CSV dataset. 

This is part of a study on collective learning undertaken by Joe Morford, Patrick Lewin, Dora Biro, Tim Guilford, Oliver Padget and Julien Collet.
